# tree-config

A hierarchical configuration library for Clojure designed to provide access to config for multiple apps
Config values are sepcfied in a hierarchy of environment/app/prop.name
It has some unique features:
  - the ability to determine the environment from IPv4 netmasks
  - support for encrypted propertes
  - Flexible configuration sources, default options include:
      - clojure maps
      - Java property files
      - environment variables
      - java properties
  - Multiple configuration  sources can be chanined together (eg. environment then a poperty file)

Sample use cases include:
 - saving application config in an edn file but reading encrypted credentials from ~/.lein/profiles.clj
 - storing all of an organisations config in a single location
 - distributing a single property file with some values overridden in dev/test/staging environments
 - loading properties from S3 when an app is deployed on ec2
